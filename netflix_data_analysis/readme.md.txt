# Netflix Data Analysis Project (SQL – PostgreSQL)

## Overview
This project presents a real-world SQL analysis of Netflix content data using PostgreSQL.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical data analyst skills through business-driven queries, not toy examples.

The dataset represents raw, denormalized Netflix metadata similar to what analysts often receive in real business environments.  
The analysis focuses on extracting meaningful insights related to content distribution, release trends, genres, directors, actors, and content characteristics.

## Objectives
- Analyze Netflix content using SQL
- Answer real business questions with correct logic
- Handle messy, real-world data
- Write clean, readable, and interview-ready SQL queries

## Business Problems Solved
This project addresses **17 real business problems**, including:

- Movies vs TV Shows distribution  
- Content release trends over time  
- Longest movies and long-running TV shows  
- Genre-wise content distribution  
- Recently added Netflix content  
- Director and actor-specific analysis  
- Detection of missing metadata  
- Content classification based on violence-related keywords  

Each problem is solved using PostgreSQL-specific SQL features and structured for clarity and correctness.

## Why This Project Matters
This project reflects how data analysts work with real datasets:
- Data is imperfect  
- Logic accuracy is critical  
- Business interpretation matters more than syntax  

It demonstrates the ability to convert raw data into actionable insights, which is essential for data analyst roles.
